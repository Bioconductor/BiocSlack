    <p class="subtitle">Explore <a href="bioconductor.org">Bioconductor</a> Slack channels at <a href="https://slack.bioconductor.org/">https://slack.bioconductor.org/</a> and join conversations that spark your interest. Our table lists all public channels, updated daily at midnight UTC. It displays the date and time of the last activity - whether it’s a message or a thread reply - alongside a notation indicating how recent this activity was at the time of the last update. Open to everyone interested in Bioconductor, these channels are a great place to participate and collaborate.</p>
</div>


<p><span style="font-size: smaller; font-style: italic;"><strong>Last Update:</strong> 2024-04-03 01:10 UTC - The “Last Activity” and “Time Since Last Activity” data points are calculated relative to this timestamp. This provides a snapshot of channel activities up to this moment.</span></p>
